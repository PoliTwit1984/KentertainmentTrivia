### Documentation Needs
- Add error handling documentation

## Environment Setup & Security

### Sensitive Data Handling
1. Environment Variables
   - Never commit sensitive data like API keys or credentials
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Create a .env file locally (it's gitignored)
   ```bash
   # .env example
   COSMOS_ENDPOINT=your_cosmos_endpoint
   COSMOS_KEY=your_cosmos_key
   ```

2. Docker Configuration
   - Use docker-compose.template.yml as a template
   - Create your local docker-compose.yml with actual values
   - docker-compose.yml is gitignored to prevent credential leaks
   ```bash
   # Create your local docker-compose.yml
   cp docker-compose.template.yml docker-compose.yml
   # Edit docker-compose.yml with your actual values
   ```

3. Running Tests
   - Set environment variables before running tests
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Set variables in your shell
   export COSMOS_ENDPOINT=your_cosmos_endpoint
   export COSMOS_KEY=your_cosmos_key
   ./run_tests.sh

   # Option 2: Use .env file
   source .env
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```

4. Security Best Practices
   - Never commit .env files
   - Never commit docker-compose.yml with real credentials
   - Use environment variables in scripts instead of hardcoded values
   - Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
   - Use GitHub's secret scanning feature
   - Review git history for sensitive data before pushing

## Implementation Details

### Authorization Fix
```python
@socketio.on('start_question')
def handle_start_question(data):
    """Start a new question round."""
    # Validate token first
    is_valid, result = verify_host_token(token)
    if not is_valid:
        emit('error', {'error': result})
        return

    # Then check host permissions
    if result != game['host_id']:
        emit('error', {'error': 'Not authorized to start questions'})
        return
```

### Disconnect Handler Fix
```python
@socketio.on('disconnect')
def handle_disconnect():
    """Handle player disconnection."""
    try:
        # Remove player from game
        player_data = game['players'].pop(player_id, None)
        game['scores'].pop(player_id, None)
        game['streaks'].pop(player_id, None)
        game['answers'].pop(player_id, None)

        # Clean up socket connection
        leave_room(pin)
        active_players.pop(sid, None)

        # Notify other players
        socketio.emit('player_left', {
            'player': player_data,
            'player_count': len(game['players'])
        }, room=pin)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in disconnect handler: {str(e)}")
```

### Game Completion Fix
```python
def handle_question_end(pin, namespace='/'):
    """End question and calculate scores."""
    game = games[pin]
    if not game['current_question']:
        return

    # Calculate scores
    for player_id, player_data in game['answers'].items():
        if time_taken <= 0 or time_taken > QUESTION_TIME_LIMIT:
            game['streaks'][player_id] = 0
            continue

        if is_correct:
            game['streaks'][player_id] += 1
            streak_bonus = game['streaks'][player_id] * STREAK_BONUS
            score = POINTS_BASE + int(time_bonus) + streak_bonus
            game['scores'][player_id] += score
```

This update reflects the current state of the project after implementing socket event handling improvements and test suite enhancements. While most core functionality is working and tested, there are three critical issues that need to be addressed in the authorization system, player disconnection handling, and game completion logic. The next focus should be on fixing these issues while maintaining the existing test coverage.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Project status has been updated in project.md with recent changes, current issues, and next steps documented. The file now reflects the latest state of the project including the three failing tests that need to be fixed:
1. Question start permissions
2. Player disconnection handling
3. Game completion scoring

The next steps and implementation details for fixing these issues have been documented.
